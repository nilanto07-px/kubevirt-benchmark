# cluster_info.yaml
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Contains metadata about your KubeVirt test cluster. This information
#   is displayed in the "Cluster Info" tab of the dashboard.
#
# Notes:
#   - This file is NOT referenced by any other scripts.
#   - Its sole purpose is to populate the "Cluster Info" tab for informational use.
#   - You can add your own display content under the "cluster" section
#     in "key" : "value" format.
#   - All entries defined under "cluster" will be shown in the dashboard tab.
